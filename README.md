The project solves the digit recognition problem on MNIST dataset.

SVC_tune_sub.py contains the principal components analysis and the support vector machines. sklearn package is used

CNN_tune_sub.py contains convolution neural network algorithm based on PyTorch package.

The dataset based on kaggle competition.
